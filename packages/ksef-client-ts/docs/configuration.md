# Configuration

`KSeFClient` accepts configuration options that control environment selection, HTTP behavior, retry logic, rate limiting, and security policies.

---

## Client Options

```ts
import { KSeFClient } from 'ksef-client-ts';

const client = new KSeFClient({
  environment: 'PROD',         // 'TEST' | 'DEMO' | 'PROD' (default: 'TEST')
  timeout: 60_000,             // Request timeout in ms (default: 30000)
  customHeaders: { 'X-Request-Id': 'abc' },
  transport: customFetchFn,    // Replace native fetch
  retry: { maxRetries: 5 },    // Partial retry policy overrides
  rateLimit: { globalRps: 20 },// Partial rate limit config (or null to disable)
  circuitBreaker: { failureThreshold: 5 }, // Opt-in circuit breaker (undefined/null disables)
  presignedUrlHosts: ['*.my-storage.com'], // Additional allowed hosts
  authManager: customAuthMgr,  // Custom AuthManager implementation
  errorFormat: 'problem-details', // 'problem-details' (default) | 'legacy'
});
```

### KSeFClientOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | `'TEST' \| 'DEMO' \| 'PROD'` | `'TEST'` | KSeF environment (sets base URLs) |
| `baseUrl` | `string` | Per environment | Override API base URL |
| `baseQrUrl` | `string` | Per environment | Override QR verification base URL |
| `lighthouseUrl` | `string` | Per environment | Override lighthouse status URL |
| `apiVersion` | `string` | `'v2'` | API version prefix |
| `timeout` | `number` | `30000` | Request timeout in milliseconds |
| `customHeaders` | `Record<string, string>` | `{}` | Additional headers on every request |
| `transport` | `TransportFn` | Native `fetch` | Custom HTTP transport function |
| `retry` | `Partial<RetryPolicy>` | See below | Retry policy overrides |
| `rateLimit` | `Partial<RateLimitConfig> \| null` | `{ globalRps: 10 }` | Rate limit config, or `null` to disable |
| `circuitBreaker` | `Partial<CircuitBreakerConfig> \| null` | — | Opt-in HTTP circuit breaker. `undefined` / omitted / `null` disables the policy entirely; pass a partial config (even `{}`) to enable with defaults merged in |
| `presignedUrlHosts` | `string[]` | — | Additional allowed hosts for presigned URLs |
| `authManager` | `AuthManager` | `DefaultAuthManager` | Custom auth/token manager |
| `errorFormat` | `'problem-details' \| 'legacy'` | `'problem-details'` | Request format for server error bodies. `'legacy'` suppresses the `X-Error-Format` header for older servers/proxies (KSeF API v2.4.0+) |

---

## Retry Policy

Failed requests are automatically retried with exponential backoff. The retry policy is merged with defaults — you only need to specify the fields you want to override.

### What gets retried

**HTTP status codes** (default): `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`

**Network errors** (when `retryNetworkErrors: true`): `ECONNRESET`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, and `AbortError` (fetch timeout).

POST requests are retried on `429` and `5xx` responses. After a thrown network error or timeout they are retried only when the connection was never established (`ECONNREFUSED`, `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`). After `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT` or `AbortError` the server may already have processed the request, so a retry could repeat its effect (open a second session, generate a second token, or get a duplicate-invoice error for an invoice that was accepted). Those errors are thrown to the caller instead. GET, PUT and DELETE are retried on every listed network error.

### Backoff formula

```
delay = min(baseDelayMs × 2^attempt + random(0, baseDelayMs), maxDelayMs)
```

For 429 responses with a `Retry-After` header, the server-specified delay is used instead of the calculated backoff. `Retry-After` is parsed as seconds (integer) or HTTP-date.

### Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxRetries` | `number` | `3` | Maximum retry attempts |
| `baseDelayMs` | `number` | `500` | Base delay in milliseconds |
| `maxDelayMs` | `number` | `30000` | Maximum delay cap in milliseconds |
| `retryableStatusCodes` | `number[]` | `[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` | HTTP status codes to retry |
| `retryNetworkErrors` | `boolean` | `true` | Retry on network errors |

### Examples

```ts
// More aggressive retries
const client = new KSeFClient({
  retry: {
    maxRetries: 5,
    baseDelayMs: 1000,
    maxDelayMs: 60_000,
  },
});

// Add 409 Conflict to retryable codes
const client = new KSeFClient({
  retry: {
    retryableStatusCodes: [409, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
  },
});

// Disable retries entirely
const client = new KSeFClient({
  retry: { maxRetries: 0 },
});
```

## Rate Limiting

A token bucket rate limiter prevents overwhelming the KSeF API. Requests exceeding the limit are delayed (not rejected).

### How it works

- **Global bucket**: All requests share a global tokens-per-second limit (default: 10 RPS)
- **Per-endpoint buckets**: Optional per-endpoint limits (created lazily on first use)
- A request must pass both the global bucket and its endpoint-specific bucket (if configured)
- Rate limit is acquired once before the retry loop; on 429 retries, a token is re-acquired
- Concurrency-safe via sequential promise chain

### Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `globalRps` | `number` | `10` | Global requests per second |
| `endpointLimits` | `Record<string, number>` | `{}` | Per-endpoint RPS limits |

### Examples

```ts
// Higher global limit
const client = new KSeFClient({
  rateLimit: { globalRps: 20 },
});

// Per-endpoint limits
const client = new KSeFClient({
  rateLimit: {
    globalRps: 15,
    endpointLimits: {
      '/v2/online/Invoice/Send': 5,
    },
  },
});

// Disable rate limiting entirely
const client = new KSeFClient({
  rateLimit: null,
});
```

### KSeF server-side limits (v2.4.0)

The KSeF API enforces its own per-endpoint caps. If you opt into client-side back-pressure via `endpointLimits`, use the values below to match the current server limits. The library does **not** apply these defaults automatically — the server enforces them regardless.

| Endpoint | req/s | req/min |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `POST /invoices/exports` | 8 | 16 |
| `POST /invoices/query/metadata` | 8 | 16 |

Prior to KSeF API v2.4.0, `POST /invoices/exports` was capped at 4 req/s and 8 req/min; v2.4.0 aligned it with `query/metadata`. The client-side token bucket only supports a per-second window — minute-level ceilings are enforced server-side only, so keep `globalRps` at or below the per-second cap to stay within the minute budget under sustained load.

---

## Circuit Breaker

Opt-in HTTP circuit breaker that fails fast when the upstream is known to be unavailable. Sits above the retry loop: once open, every matching request raises `KSeFCircuitOpenError` without hitting the network, so a batch of requests during an outage consumes **one** retry budget instead of one-per-request. When the cooldown elapses, the breaker lets a single probe through; on success it clears, on failure it re-opens. See [HTTP Resilience — Circuit Breaker](./http-resilience.md#circuit-breaker) for the state machine and retry-loop interaction.

The feature is **off by default.** Pass a (possibly empty) partial config to enable it; `null` and `undefined` both disable.

### What counts as a failure

| Outcome | Counted? |
| --- | --- |
| Network error (`ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc.) | Yes |
| 5xx response after retries exhausted | Yes |
| 429 Too Many Requests | No (throttling, not an outage) |
| 401 Unauthorized | No (auth problem, not availability) |
| 2xx / 4xx (other than 401/429) | No (records success) |

### Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `failureThreshold` | `number` | `5` | Consecutive failures within `openMs` before opening. Must be > 0. |
| `openMs` | `number` | `30000` | Cooldown window in ms. Requests fail fast while open; one probe is allowed after it elapses. Must be > 0. |
| `scope` | `'global' \| 'endpoint'` | `'global'` | `'global'` uses one breaker for the whole client. `'endpoint'` keeps per-endpoint state so an outage on one route leaves the others alone. |

### Examples

```ts
// Enable with defaults (threshold 5, cooldown 30s, global scope)
const client = new KSeFClient({
  circuitBreaker: {},
});

// Aggressive: open sooner, stay open longer, per-endpoint scope
const client = new KSeFClient({
  circuitBreaker: {
    failureThreshold: 3,
    openMs: 60_000,
    scope: 'endpoint',
  },
});

// Explicitly disable (same as omitting the option)
const client = new KSeFClient({
  circuitBreaker: null,
});
```

Handle the new error class where it makes sense:

```ts
import { KSeFCircuitOpenError } from 'ksef-client-ts';

try {
  await client.invoices.sendInvoice(xml);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof KSeFCircuitOpenError) {
    // Park the work for later; don't retry-storm a known-down upstream
    await parkForLater(xml, err.retryAfterMs);
    return;
  }
  throw err;
}
```

## Presigned URL Policy

When downloading files from presigned URLs returned by the KSeF API (e.g., batch exports, UPO downloads), the library validates URLs against a security policy to prevent SSRF attacks.

### Security checks (in order)

1. **HTTPS enforcement** — HTTP URLs are rejected (default: enabled)
2. **Host whitelist** — Only URLs matching allowed host patterns are permitted. Wildcard patterns (`*.domain.com`) match any subdomain. Default: `['*.ksef.mf.gov.pl']`
3. **Redirect parameter blocking** — URLs containing `redirect`, `callback`, `return_url`, or `next` query parameters are rejected (case-insensitive)
4. **Private IP rejection** — URLs targeting private/reserved IPs are rejected:
   - IPv4: `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `169.254.0.0/16`
   - IPv6: `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`

The first failing check throws `KSeFValidationError`.

### Adding allowed hosts

Use `presignedUrlHosts` in client options to add hosts beyond the default `*.ksef.mf.gov.pl`:

```ts
const client = new KSeFClient({
  presignedUrlHosts: ['*.my-corporate-storage.com', 'cdn.example.com'],
});
```

The additional hosts are merged with the defaults — you don't need to repeat `*.ksef.mf.gov.pl`.

---

## Custom Transport

Replace the default `fetch` with a custom transport function for testing, logging, or proxying.

### Type signature

```ts
type TransportFn = (url: string, init: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>;
```

The transport receives the fully-constructed URL and `RequestInit` (including method, headers, body, and `AbortSignal` for timeouts).

### Examples

```ts
// Logging transport
const client = new KSeFClient({
  transport: async (url, init) => {
    console.log(`${init.method} ${url}`);
    const start = Date.now();
    const res = await fetch(url, init);
    console.log(`${res.status} in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
    return res;
  },
});

// Mock transport for tests
const client = new KSeFClient({
  transport: async (url, init) => {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    });
  },
});

// Proxy transport
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici';

const agent = new ProxyAgent('http://proxy.corp.com:8080');
const client = new KSeFClient({
  transport: (url, init) => fetch(url, { ...init, dispatcher: agent }),
});
```
